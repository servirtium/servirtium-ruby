# Servirtium

![](Servirtium-Square.png?raw=true)

Servirtium == Service Virtualized HTTP (for Java) in a record/playback style, with plain 
Markdown recordings

Utilization of "Service Virtualization" is best practice towards fast and 
consistent test automation. This tech should be used in conjunction with 
JUnit/TestNG, etc.  Versus alternate technologies, Servirtium utilizes Markdown
for recorded HTTP conversations, which aids readability allows for diffing 
to quickly determine if contracts are broken. That last is an important aspect
when Service Virtualization is part of a **Technology Compatibility Kit**

Version [0.1.0](lib/servirtium/version.rb): This is very much an alpha version of this gem. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'servirtium', git: 'git@github.com:servirtium/servirtium-ruby.git'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

## Design goals 

1. By being a "man in the middle" it enables the recording of HTTP conversations and store them in 
   Markdown under source-control co-located with the automated tests themselves. 
2. In playback, Servirtium allows the functionality tested in the service tests to be isolated from 
   potentially flaky and unquestionably slower "down stack" and external remote services.
3. A diffable format (regular Markdown files) to clearly show the differences between two recordings 
   of the same conversation, that is co-located with test logic (no database of any sort).
4. Agnostic about other test frameworks: use RSpec, MiniTest, or Cucumber.
5. No process spawning/killing orchestration.
6. One recording per test method, even if that means duplicate sections of markdown over many tests.
7. No conditionals or flow control in the recording - no DSL at all. 
8. Allowance for modification of recording or playback for simplification/redaction purposes.
9. For use **in the same process** as the test-runner. It is not designed to be a standalone server, 
   although it can be used that way.

## What do recordings look like?

### Raw recording source (Markdown)

Here's a shorted source form for a recorded conversation

### Rendered Markdown in the GitHub UI

Best to see a real one here [in situ on GitHub](https://github.com/paul-hammant/climate-data-tck/blob/master/src/test/mocks/averageRainfallForEgyptFrom1980to1999Exists.md) 
rather than the minimal example above. You can see the rendering there (best for human eyes), 
but also a snap-shot of that here:

### More info

See 
[ExampleSubversionCheckoutRecording.md](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/resources/ExampleSubversionCheckoutRecording.md) 
which was recorded from a real Subversion 'svn' command line client doing it's thing, but 
thru Servirtium as a HTTP-proxy. After the recording of that, the replay side of Servirtium was able 
to pretend to be Apache+Subversion for a fresh 'svn checkout' command. 
[This one](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/java/com/paulhammant/servirtium/SubversionCheckoutRecorderMain.java) 
was the recorder, and [this one](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/java/com/paulhammant/servirtium/SubversionCheckoutReplayerMain.java) 
the replayer for that recorded conversation.

## Implementation Limitations

1. The recorder **isn't very good at handling parallel requests**. Most of the 
   things you want to test will be serial (and  short) but if your client is a browser, 
   then you should half expect for parallelized operations.

1. Servirtium can't yet listen on over HTTPS.

1. Servirtium can't yet function as a HTTP Proxy server. It must be a "man in the middle", 
   meaning you have to be able to override the endpoints of services during test harness invocation 
   in order to be able to record them (and play them back).
 
1. Some server technologies (like Amazon S3) sign payloads in a way that breaks for middle-man 
   deployments. See [S3](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/wiki/S3).

## Notable examples of use

### SvnMerkleizer project - emulation of Subversion in tests

[Read more about two seprate uses of Servirtium for this project](docs/SvnMerkleizer_More_Info.md)

### Climate API demo

The World Bank's Climate Data service turned into a Java library with Servirtium tests: 
https://github.com/paul-hammant/climate-data-tck. Direct, record and playback modes of 
operation for the same tests.

### Todobackend record and playback

[TodobackendDotComServiceRecording.md](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/resources/TodobackendDotComServiceRecording.md) 
is a recording of the Mocha test site of "TodoBackend.com" against a real Ruby/Sinatra/Heroku 
endpoint. This is not an example of something you'd orchestrate in Java/JUnit, but it is 
an example of a sophisticated series of interactions over HTTP between a client (the browser) 
and that Heroku server. Indeed, the intent of the site is show that multiple backends should be
compatible with that JavaScript/Browser test suite.

[Here's the code for the recorder](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/java/com/paulhammant/servirtium/SubversionCheckoutRecorderMain.java) 
of that, and [here's the code for the replayer](https://github.com/paul-hammant/servirtium/blob/master/src/test/java/com/paulhammant/servirtium/SubversionCheckoutReplayerMain.java)
for that.  

Note: playback does not pass all the tests because there's a randomized GUID in the request 
payload that changes every time you run the test suite. It gets one third of the way through though.

**Note: this limitation is being resolved, presently**

## Legal warning

Be careful: your contracts and EULAs with service providers (as well as application/server makers 
for on-premises) might not allow you to reverse engineer their over-the-wire APIs.  

A real case: [Reverse engineering of competitorâ€™s software cost company big](http://blog.internetcases.com/2017/10/24/reverse-engineering-of-competitors-software-cost-company-big/)
... and you might say that such clauses are needed to prevent licensees from competing with the 
original company with arguably "stolen" IP. 

We (developers and test engineers) might morally think that we should be OK for this, as we're just 
doing it for test-automation purposes. No matter, the contracts that are signed often make no such 
distinction, but the case above was where the original maker of an API went after a company that was 
trying to make something for the same ecosystem without a commercial relation on that specifically.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. 
Then, run `rake` to run Rubocop and the tests. 

There is also a "Technology Compatibility Kit" (TCK) that can be found at: 
https://github.com/servirtium/demo-ruby-climate-tck
