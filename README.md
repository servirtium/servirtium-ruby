Initial should happen in https://github.com/servirtium/demo-ruby-climate-data-tck. At a certain level of viability, a library will be extracted from that demo and put in here for continued work.

Help is needed to methodically work on that demo, then later refactoring it to have a library in this repo - email paul@hammant.org (or get engaged the modern way: in issues and pull-requests)
